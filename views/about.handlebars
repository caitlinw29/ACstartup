  <h2 id="FAQ" class="mt-4">FAQ</h2>
  <ul class="mt-2" id="faq-ul">
    <li>Q: Does this website cost money to use? <br/><br/>A: No, it is completely free (and ad-free). I will never ask for your credit card info or request any form of payment.</li>
    <li>Q: How will you use my information? <br/><br/>A: Your email is solely used to access your account. I will not be emailing you unless it is for security purposes, or to respond to you if you fill out the feedback/questions form. </li>
    <li>Q: Help! I can't remember my password! <br/><br/>A: I do not currently have any sort of password retrieval set up. I also do not have access to user passwords. I could possibly delete your account for you so that you can remake it with the same email (reach out in the feedback/questions form).</li>
    <li>Q: How do I customize my pages? <br/><br/>A: Most customization is done through the settings tab once you are logged in. You can also edit your to-do list directly from your home page.</li>
    <li>Q: Can I have more than one island/account? <br/><br/>A: You can only have one account per email but you are welcome to have as many character profiles/islands as you would like. To add a profile, go to either the profile tab or the settings tab.</li>
    <li>Q: I've been playing a week...month...etc. Do I have to start the guide from day 1? <br/><br/>A: Nope! When you are making your account, you can select a "custom" timeline. You will need to check off the items you have already completed in the game, and then a custom starting guide will be made for you based on your progress. </li>
    <li>Q: What's the difference from starting at game launch versus day 1? <br/><br/>A: Game launch starts the guide from the airport scene when you first turn the game on. Day 1 starts with the first "offical" day in the game (when you wake up after the party).</li>
    <li>Q: How do I delete my account? <br/><br/>A: There is a delete option once you are signed in. If you cannot remember your password to delete your own account, you may request help in the feedback/questions form. I will ask you to verify that it is your account by emailing me from the email you wish to delete the account of.</li>
    <li>Q: I restarted...how do I refresh the guide? <br/><br/>A: There is a restart option in the settings!</li>
    <li>Q: Can I see active creatures? <br/><br/>A: Yes! First make sure the clock is set correctly to match your in-game date and time. Then click on the museum button, and there will be an active creatures button. You can choose to sort by the creatures that sell for the most bells, creatures you still need to catch, etc.</li>
    <li>Q: Can I time travel? <br/><br/>A: Of course! Just adjust the time and date from the time/date tab and your guide will adjust with you!</li>
    <li>Q: I didn't finish all of the tasks for the day...what now? <br/><br/>A: No worries! The guide will move any unfinished tasks to the next day when applicable. If you forget to mark a task as completed, you can edit the guide at any time to make those changes.</li>
    <li>Q: How do I give feedback to the developer/ask for a new feature? <br/><br/>A: There is a button to email me on this page. I welcome feedback, good or bad! This is a passion project, so I make no promises on updates/features but I will do my best to help if I can!</li>
    <li>Q: How can I see what I already have collected in the game to add to my collections? <br/><br/>A: You can check most collections from your nookphone or catalog! Your catalog will have furniture, clothes, walls, floors, songs, posters, rugs, fossils/art that you've touched (if you donate all of your fossils/art right away, this is quicker than visiting the museum to check). You can check your creatures in the critterpedia. Reactions are accessed by hitting the ZR button. DIYS can be seen in the DIY app on the nookphone. </li>
    <li>Q: Can I customize my to-do list? <br/><br/>A: Yes! All to-do list items are customizable by hitting the edit to-do list button. I offer pre-made items for the most popular tasks, but you can change those as you see fit. You also can delete tasks, or create your own at any time.</li>
    <li>Q: How do I add my current villagers/update them? <br/><br/>A: Through your profile!</li>
    <li>Q: Is there a turnip log? <br/><br/>A: Yes, the turnip log is linked directly to the "check turnip prices" tasks. If you make your own task for checking prices, make sure to link it to the turnip log so that you can check your patterns!</li>
